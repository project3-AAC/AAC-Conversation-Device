My name is Thomas McManus. 
I live in Chicago and I work at an ICF for adults with developmental disabilities as an RBT. 
I love to learn Korean 
and listen to music in my free time. 
I also lift weights three times a week. 
I have a girlfriend named Paulina. 
My mom's name is Deborah and she lives in Minneapolis. 
My sister, Alison, lives in Baltimore and works as a professor at Johns Hopkins University. 
My Dad lives in Minneapolis too. My parents are divorced. 
They are both retired. 
In 2024 I want to meditate more and maintain a healthy sleep schedule. 
I love Cats. I used to have two cats named Madge and Ivi but they passed away.
