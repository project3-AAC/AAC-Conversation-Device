# AI Powered AAC Device

# Elevator Pitch

Do you or someone that you know have a speech impairment or disability with severe communication disorders?
If so, than the talker app is perfect for you! This app makes communication very simple
by providing you with pictures and text to speech as responses to any question you might have.
Just ask a question in the app to get started today!

# Description

We have created an app that helps supplement or compensate for the
impairment and disability patterns of individuals with severe expressive communication disorders.
When asked a question in the app, the OpenAI pulls responses for
the question asked along with pictures and a text to speech button
